**DevOpsBot**

The CronOps DevOpsBot Slack integration will power your team DevOps culture understanding, aiming to promote
Product owners, Development, QA, IT Operations, and Infosec work together, not only to help each other, but also to
ensure that the overall organization succeeds. By working toward a common goal, they enable the fast flow of planned
work into production (e.g., performing tens, hundreds, or even thousands of code deploys per day), while achieving
world-class stability, reliability, availability, and security.
