**DevOps Tips**

_“DevOps relies on bodies of knowledge from Lean, Theory of Constraints,
 the Toyota Production System, resilience engineering, learning organizations, safety culture, human factors,
 and many others. Other valuable contexts that DevOps draws from include high-trust management cultures, servant
 leadership, and organizational change management. The result is world-class reliability, stability, and security
 at ever lower cost and effort; and accelerated flow and reliability through the technology value stream, including
 Product Mgmt, Development, QA, IT Operations, and Infosec.”_
